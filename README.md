Welcome to Python-Fun! This repository is a personal collection of Python scripts and projects designed for learning, experimentation, and enjoyment. It includes a mix of games, networking utilities, data processing examples, automation tools, and miscellaneous scripts. Whether you're exploring Python basics or diving into more advanced topics like network analysis or scheduling, there's something here to tinker with.
The projects range from fun games like Hangman and Poker to practical tools for scanning networks or handling data with libraries like NumPy and Pandas. Note that some scripts (e.g., networking tools) are intended for educational purposes only—always use them responsibly, ethically, and in compliance with applicable laws.
